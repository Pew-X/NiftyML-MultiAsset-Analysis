# NiftyML-MultiAsset-Analysis

## Introduction
NiftyML-MultiAsset-Analysis is a comprehensive financial analysis that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze multiple assets, with a focus on the Bank Nifty index. This project demonstrates advanced capabilities in data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and financial modeling.

## Project Overview
This project combines various aspects of quantitative finance and machine learning to provide insights into asset behavior, predict future prices, optimize portfolios, and manage risk. It's divided into several key components:

1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
2. Technical Indicator Analysis
3. Multi-Asset Price Prediction
4. Portfolio Optimization
5. Advanced Risk Management
6. Visualization and Reporting

## Detailed Components

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- Utilizes `yfinance` to fetch historical data for multiple assets, including the Bank Nifty index.
- Implements data cleaning and feature engineering techniques.
- Calculates daily returns and handles missing data.

### 2. Technical Indicator Analysis
- Calculates various technical indicators:
  - Moving Averages (7-day and 21-day)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Momentum and Log Momentum
- Visualizes correlations between assets and technical indicators using heatmaps.

### 3. Multi-Asset Price Prediction
Implements and compares multiple machine learning models:

a) LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network
   - Utilize  Keras/PyTorch for implementation
   - Includes multiple LSTM layers with dropout for regularization
   - Predicts prices for multiple assets simultaneously

b) Random Forest Regressor
   - Implements using scikit-learn
   - Utilizes ensemble learning for robust predictions

c) XGBoost Regressor
   - Leverages the XGBoost library for gradient boosting
   - Optimized for performance and accuracy

d) Ensemble Model
   - Combines predictions from LSTM, Random Forest, and XGBoost
   - Weighted average of individual model predictions for improved accuracy

### 4. Portfolio Optimization
- Implements Modern Portfolio Theory for optimal asset allocation
- Calculates efficient frontier to visualize risk-return tradeoffs
- Optimizes portfolio weights to maximize Sharpe Ratio

### 5. Advanced Risk Management
a) Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation
   - Historical VaR
   - Parametric VaR
   - Monte Carlo VaR

b) Expected Shortfall (ES) / Conditional VaR (CVaR)
   - Calculates ES using multiple methods for a more comprehensive risk assessment

c) Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis
   - Implements various market scenarios (e.g., mild recession, market crash)
   - Analyzes portfolio performance under stressed conditions

d) Correlation Stress Test
   - Examines how asset correlations change during stressed market conditions

### 6. Visualization and Reporting
- Utilizes matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for creating insightful visualizations
- Generates various plots including:
  - Asset price trends
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Efficient frontier
  - VaR and ES comparisons
  - Stress test results
